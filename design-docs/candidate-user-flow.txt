1. Candidate completes the event sign-up process on CharterSchoolJobs.com which include providing basic contact information, the type of job they seek, any state teaching or pupil services certifications they hold, and uploading a current copy of their resume.
2. The candidate's resume and credentials are reviewed by a member of our team to determine if they meet the minimum qualifications to participate in the fair.
3. The candidate is then notified via email whether or not they are approved to participate.
4. If approved, the candidate is admitted to the event's Candidate Portal where they can view participating schools' profile and what job-types for which they are recruiting.
5. The candidate, through the Candidate Portal submits requests to schools they would like to interview with at the event. 
6. Schools review candidate interview requests (which includes access to the candidate's resume submitted when they signed up) and approves or denies the interview request.
7. If approved, the candidate can then (in the Candidate Portal) schedule a specific 10-minute interview time-slot.
8. On event day, at the allotted time, (through the Candidate Portal) the candidate connects to the video meeting room where 1 - 3 members of the school team conduct the interview.
